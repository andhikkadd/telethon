# Telegram Userbot Promotion Framework

A resilient, modular, and fully documented Telegram userbot framework built on **Telethon**. It is designed to run 24/7 on any server/VPS using a process manager like **PM2** or **systemd** to automate message wave distributions and monitor target group health.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a **Telegram Userbot** running on a standard Telegram user account (not a BotFather bot token). Do NOT share your `.session` files in the `sessions/` directory or your `.env` credentials with anyone, and never push them to public Git repositories!

## Key Features

- **Strict Master Authorization**: Restricts bot command processing to authorized user IDs (`MASTER_ID`) or usernames (`MASTER_USERNAME`).
- **Concurrent Web Control Panel**: A built-in dark-themed **FastAPI + Jinja2** admin dashboard running in the same event loop for managing settings, targets, logs, templates, and backups.
- **Group Health & Validation**: Monitors target groups, tracking error states such as `FLOOD_WAIT` cooldowns, `MUTED` channels, and `NO_PERMISSION` blocks. Automates skipping of broken channels after 3 consecutive failures.
- **Automated Async Scheduler**: Automatically dispatches promo messages ("waves") at randomized delay intervals (e.g., 60-180 minutes) with safe rate-limiting delays between individual groups.
- **GPG AES256 Encrypted Backups**: Compresses codebase, SQLite databases, and Telethon session files, encrypts them securely using GPG, forwards the package to your personal Telegram chat, and purges temporary files from disk.
- **Server Health Metrics**: Monitors CPU load, RAM usage, disk space, and application uptime directly from Telegram commands or the web panel.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andhikkadd/telethon.git
cd your-repo/
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup Configuration
Copy the template configuration file and configure your API credentials:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

### 4. Bootstrapping (First-Time Login)
Run the application interactively once to complete the Telegram authentication process:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
- Enter your phone number in international format (e.g., `+62xxxx`).
- Input the OTP code sent to your Telegram account.
- Input your Two-Step Verification (2FA) password if enabled.
- Once logged in, terminate the script using `Ctrl + C`. Your session files are now securely saved in `sessions/`.

### 5. Start Background Daemon via PM2
```bash
pm2 start main.py --name "promo-userbot" --interpreter python3
```
